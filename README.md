# Machine Learning using Tensorflow

Tensorflow is an open source machine learning (ML) library from Google. It has particularly became popular because of the support for Deep Learning. Apart from that it's highly scalable and can run locally on Android. The documentation is well maintained and several tutorials available for different expertise levels. To learn more about downloading and installing Tesnorflow, visit official website (www.tensorflow.org).

Below mentioned algorithms (available as IPython notebooks). 

* Linear regression for housing price prediction (Boston dataset )
* Logistic regression for multi-class classification (Iris dataset)
* K Nearest Neighbours for letter recognition (Letter Recognition dataset)
* Logistic regression with SMOTE for anomaly detection
* Convolution Neural Network for custom image dataset
